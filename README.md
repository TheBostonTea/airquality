# Airquality

This repository contains air quality data from https://www.luchtmeetnet.nl/rapportages, concerning yearly averages of O_{3} concentrations from 2015 until 2021 in micrograms per cubic meter.
The data is sorted by area code. Which area code refers to which location is stored in a area_code_name.csv file. Some data may be less accurate, as the measuring stations were offline more than 90% of the measured time intervals, these measurements are denoted 'N' in the final column. Several values are left empty, so this must be taken into account when one wants to work with this data.
